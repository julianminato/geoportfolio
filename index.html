		This website is the geoportfolio of Julian Minato. The website entails
		information that is academically and professionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		I am an aspiring geospatial scientist currently in my third-year of studying a Bachelor of Geospatial Science (Honours) degree at RMIT University. 
		My geospatial-related interests are anything Cartography related - I love the map making process and being able to visualise information in a manner that anyone can interpret. 
		My most recent geospatial project covered a Spatial Distribution, Clustering and Population Analysis of Melbourneâ€™s Metropolitan Train Network. Some outputs from this project can be seen in this portfolio.

		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->

			Below are the three maps that I have created as part of my course:

	<div class="paragraphs">
		Spatial Information System Analytics is the third and final SIS subject in the degree. It focuses on quantitative methods of spatial pattern analytics applicable to different types of geographical data
		and emphasises spatial, statistical, and numerical techniques for describing, analysing, and comparing spatial patterns so that spatial relationships among relevant geographical phenomena can be characterised, modelled, predicted, or optimised. 
		The topics in the subject included statistical measures and GIS-based methods for the following:
		<ul>
			<li>Spatial Interpolation</li>
			<li>Spatial Pattern Analysis</li>
			<li>Regression Analysis</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2024 version of the course which I completed, the final assignment was to answer a practical geographical question as a geospatial analyst.
		It involved gathering data, devising an analytical process, and producing results in order to answer the question.
		My aim was to investigate the spatial distribution of stations and analyse ridership patterns of Melbourne's metropolitan
		train network to help make formulated decisions.

		As part of the project I produced the following maps: 
		<ul>
			<li>Melbourne's Metropolitan Train Network Map (manually compiled from raw station spatial data)</li>
			<li>Near Analysis of Melbourne's Road Network to the nearest Metropolitan Train Station</li>
			<li>A heat map of patronage on the network</li>
			<li>A population density map of Urban Melbourne</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			All maps were created using raw spatial data collected from DataVic and Public Transport Victoria.
			All maps were constructed and outputted with ArcGIS Pro.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2022) within the geospatial science industry. The two main companies that I have worked at 
		were AAM Group and Tetra Tech. This page will outline my experience gained and skills I have learned from working at AAM Group and Tetra Tech along with an
		overview of my current geospatial skillset.

	<div class="job-overview">
		My time at AAM Group was part of an internship for the thirty day work experience subject. The work experience subject taught me a lot about what industry
		standard work is done within the geospatial industry. I chose to work at AAM Group as I read about it online on how it is a large company that does a lot of
		geospatial activity and to my personal knowledge, is one of the few companies that specialise solely on different forms of geospatial work as their primary
		source of business compared to other companies that have a spatial team but the company itself does not specialise in geospatial work. The work at AAM Group in 
		the Melbourne office was less about performing geospatial analysis on pre-existing data, but rather capturing and collecting their own spatial data which 
		the mapping team process and edit into a usable form for the client.
		<p>
		As part of the mapping team, the work I was exposed to was editing and processing aerial imagery-based data. The work consisted of editing out distortions and 
		errors in the aerial imagery, manipulating colour bands of the orthomosaics to brighten or darken the imagery to the client's needs and creating Digital 
		Terrain Models from provided LIDAR captured imagery from elevation models. My work at AAM Group used less ArcGIS products than I initially believed, using
		other programs such as Global Mapper and AAM-exclusive products due to their Melbourne work being focused on aerial imagery rather than spatial data analysis.

	<div class="job-overview">
		My work at Tetra Tech as part of the spatial team involves using the ArcGIS suite for producing figures and maps for both internal staff members from other
		departments and entites from external companies. The work is primarily modifying and publishing maps based on the specifications outlined by the client, either
		editing the pre-existing data to be updated or creating new figures and information for visualisation on the maps. A lot of the work requires knowledge of
		programming languages such as Python, Visual Basic (VB) and SQL to assist with automating tasks and sorting through spatial databases and attribute tables. 
		<p>
		The work that I have done is not limited to spatial analysis. At one point, I was publishing raster datasets for Web GIS-use and another, I was checking off
		graphs to make sure that the graphs had all the data required on them, either adding the data onto the graph myself if the data is available or outlining the 
		graphs with the missing data for inspection by another staff member if I cannot add the data onto the graph myself.
